VLANs
  * Virtual Local Area Networks are logically separated networks on a singular switch
  * Like devices within a subnet, devices within a VLAN have their own broadcast domain
  * Trunking allows multiple VLANs to communicate through a singular port, i.e., multiple VLANs communicating through a single switchport to a router in order for the VLANs to connect

DHCP
  * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to automatically allocate IPv4 addresses within a given address pool
  * Routers can serve as DHCP servers in lieu of a dedicated physical DHCP server, particularly in home network environments
